            <p>The deal will allow SpiceJet to induct efficient and younger MAX aircraft into its fleet, and ensure resumption of deliveries of the 155 MAX aircraft it had ordered</p>
            <p>Budget airline SpiceJet Ltd has entered into a settlement agreement with aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. on outstanding claims related to the grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft, it said on Wednesday.</p>
            <p>In a filing with the bourses, the company said Boeing has agreed to offer certain accommodations and settle the outstanding dues related to the grounding of 737 MAX aircraft and its return to service.</p>
            <p>Tata Motors intends to use the funds, which it will receive in exchange for compulsorily convertible preference shares issued to TPG, to create a portfolio of EVs and dedicated battery electric vehicle (BEV) platforms.</p>
            <p>EVCo will also invest in battery technologies and charging infrastructure in association with Tata Power Ltd.</p>
            <p>Moody's Investors Service noted that the automaker has an early mover advantage in EVs in India, but faces challenges in scaling the business.</p>
            <p>The deal will allow SpiceJet to induct efficient and younger MAX aircraft into its fleet, and ensure resumption of deliveries of the 155 MAX aircraft it had ordered.p>
                <p>"The scaling up of the EV market will depend on the pace of development and installation of charging infrastructure. High EV prices also weigh on demand as internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles are relatively cheaper," it added.</p>
                <p>It however, pointed out that carbon transition is a risk as long as Tata motors remains primarily concentrated in ICE vehicles.</p>
                <p>However, the airline, which had 13 737 Max aircraft at the time of the ban, did not disclose the financial terms of the settlement. Spicejet has been claiming the compensation amount from Boeing as other income in its quarterly results.</p>
                <p>“Certain costs (including, inter alia, aircraft and supplemental lease rentals and certain other identified expenses related to Boeing 737 MAX aircraft) aggregating ₹146.08 crore and ₹289.65 crore for the quarter and half year ended 30
                    September 2021 ( ₹143.56 crore for the quarter ended 30 June 2021, ₹138.870 crore and ₹278.91 crore for the quarter and half year ended 30 September 2020 and ₹560.44 crore for the year ended 31 March 2021) have been recognized as other
                    income," the company’s auditors noted in its September quarter results.</p>
                <p>The statement comes after SpiceJet on 13 September said it had entered into a settlement with CDB Aviation, a major lessor of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. On 26 August, the airline said it had agreed to a settlement with Avolon, another major
                    lessor of the aircraft.</p>
                <p>In August, India’s air safety regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), had cleared the 737 MAX planes to fly after the near two-and-a-half-year ban following two fatal crashes in 2019.</p>

                <p>The settlements with Boeing and lessors, and the reintroduction of the 737MAX aircraft will help the struggling company to take on the rising competition in the Indian aviation space with the entry of Rakesh Jhunjunwala-backed low-cost
                    airline Akasa Air.</p>
                <p>On Tuesday, Akasa Air said it has placed order for 72 Boeing 737 MAX jets. The airline is planning flights across India from the summer of 2022.</p>
                <p>SpiceJet Ltd cut down its net loss to ₹561 crore for the September quarter. It posted a loss of ₹729 crore in the June quarter and ₹112 crore in the September quarter of 2020.</p>
                <p>Its revenue from operations rose 23% to ₹1,342 crore for the quarter against ₹1,089 crore in the June quarter.</p>
